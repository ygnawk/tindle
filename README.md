Tindle - A HackMIT Project

Built a social networking platform based on book preferences of users.

Used Django as back-end and PostgreSQL as the database to implemented search functionality and an interface that allow users to rate books. 

Implemented a na√Øve similarity algorithm between two users using data from Goodreads to initialize the database and their own ratings on the books they have read.
